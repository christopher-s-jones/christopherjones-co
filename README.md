# Personal Website (christopherjones.co)

Welcome! I built this site using the awesome AstroJS framework for static sites.
I love the Jekyll/Hugo pattern for static site generation from Markdown
content, but Astro also provides web component framework support for 
React, Vue, Solid, etc. so it's a real gift for creating static sites 
with islands of JS/TS support as needed.  Thank you Astro.
